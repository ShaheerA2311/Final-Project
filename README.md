# Final-Year-Project

<p>Here is more information about this project.</p>

<p>The 'DLL-files' folder contains the DLL that was compiled for Solution 2 but was not compatible with Unity</p>

<p>The FYP folder contains the C++-side script and all required additional dependencies from the Force Dimension SDK. The script itself can be found at FYP/Final-System/Final-System/gravity.
  The 'gravity-VS2019.sln' file is all that is required to be compiled and executed
</p>

<p>Also included is the 'SocketClient.cs' script which is the game object script attached to the SlicingPlane in the Unity scene</p>

<p>Finally, a short video demo of the system is included. The .mp4 may be overly exposed due to the video being filmed in HVEC format. If this is an issue I have also included the same video on .mov format, but a separate player may be required if your system does not support it</p>
